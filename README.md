Handwritten digit recognition is a pivotal technology at the intersection of artificial 
intelligence and practical applications. This presentation delves into the techniques and 
significance of recognizing handwritten digits, a challenge that has evolved from simple 
template matching to sophisticated deep learning models. We will explore the historical context 
of digit recognition, tracing its development from early methods to the contemporary use of 
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
   Key applications of handwritten digit recognition will be covered, demonstrating its 
impact across sectors such as postal services, finance, healthcare, and education. The 
technologyâ€™s ability to automate data entry, enhance accuracy, and streamline processes 
underscores its importance in both practical and theoretical contexts.
